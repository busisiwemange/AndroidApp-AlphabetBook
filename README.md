# Android Application - Alphabet Book

Implementing an alphabet book in Android. Included as an attachment in this assignment is a set of 26 images, one for each letter of the alphabet . There are two main views for the app, an
overview pae, which has a button for each letter of the alphabet, and a letter page, which will show the image corresponding to the selected letter.

On the letter pages, there should be five buttons:

• First page (‘A ’)

• Previous page

• Next page

• Last page (‘Z’)

• Overview

When you open the application, it should always open to the last letter (or page) viewed, unless it was last opened on the overview page, in which case it should open on the overview page. The images should be stored on the phone filesystem rather than compiled into the application under resources. If you choose to use icons for the buttons or the overview page, you may place those in the resources.
